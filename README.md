# ZPR_chess

To run the application, cmake==3.9+, python==3.8.0+ and pip==21.0.1+ are required.
Once you have it downloaded, simply fire up run.sh script. Any other dependencies will be installed in project directory - you don't have to worry about us installing garbage on your computer :)
  
To run tests, Boost.Test is required. You can run the tests by running the run_test.sh script.  
  
To generate the documentation, you need to have doxygen and graphviz installed.    
Documentation is generated with run.sh script and available from main view of the application.  
  
Good luck in your chess games!
