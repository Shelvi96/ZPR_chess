# ZPR_chess

To run the application, cmake==3.9+, python==3.8.0+ and pip==21.0.1+ are required.  
Once you have it downloaded, simply fire up run.sh script. Any other dependencies will be installed in project directory - you don't have to worry about us installing garbage on your computer :)  
  
To generate the documentation, you need to have doxygen and graphviz installed.    
Run 'make doc' to generate the documentation.  
  
Good luck in your chess games!
